# ES6 data manipulation
In this directory we will explore several JS data structures.  We will practice using them and manipulating their data.  Among the objectives will be diferenctiating between `Array` and `Typed array`,  how to map, filter, and reduce arrays, and finally, what are Sets, Maps, and WeakMaps.
