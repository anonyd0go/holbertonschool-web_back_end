# Web Back-end
This directory introduces us to JavaScript and ES6 concepts for web development.  Each direcory dives into some of the concepts through JS and Node.js.

## [ES6 Basic](/ES6_basic/)
This is an itroduction into JavaScript with the use of Node.js. 

## [ES6 classes](/ES6_classes/)
In this directory we will go over creating classes in JavaScript with the ES6 adaptations.  We will explore all aspects of class creations in JS from its definition to its methods and how to extend a class from another.  We will also look at Metaprograming and symbols.

## [ES6 data manipulation](/ES6_data_manipulation/)
In this directory we will explore several JS data structures.  We will practice using them and manipulating their data.  Among the objectives will be diferenctiating between `Array` and `Typed array`,  how to map, filter, and reduce arrays, and finally, what are Sets, Maps, and WeakMaps.

## [ES6 Promises](/ES6_promise/)
This directory will focus on JS use of Promises: What they are, why we use them and how they are used.  We will understand how to use the methods of the Promis object (and promis-like objects), trying and throwing errors, using the await operator, and using async functions.
